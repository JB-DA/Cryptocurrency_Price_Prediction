### CRYPTOCURRENCY PRICE PREDICTION with MACHINE LEARNING
> An adventure in predicting future prices of cryptocurrency

The popularity of cryptocurrencies increased exponentially in 2017 due to several consecutive months growth of their market capitalization. The entire cryptocurrency market was worth more than $1,833,940,056,538 AUD in early February 2021 due to several factors that saw massive spikes in prices.

Machine learning can work through many problems, but its application in predicting crypto prices may be limited by several factors. As cryptocurrencies are decentralised, they have more factors that influence their price than traditional assets, which can make modeling & predictions very hard. Some factors affecting cryptocurrencies are technological progress, political pressures, security, consumer sentiment, sheer variety of currencies etc. Their high volatility can be very rewarding if they are traded at the correct time. Unfortunately, due to their lack of indexes, cryptocurrencies are relatively unpredictable compared to traditional financial models.
While this project may not yield applicable models & predictions, it is an interesting exercise to see how close machine learning can come to the actual values.
